# Causal-Inference
Predict whether the cancer is __benign__ or __malignant__
# Business Need
When it comes to getting business insights from tabular data, the most interesting questions (from their perspective) are often not answerable with observational data alone!
__Judea Pearl__ and his research group have developed in the last decades a solid theoretical framework to deal with that, but the first steps toward merging it with mainstream machine learning are just beginning. 

The __causal graph__ is a central object in the framework mentioned above, but it is often unknown, subject to personal knowledge and bias, or loosely connected to the available data.

# objective
In this task we will highlight the importance of the matter in a concrete way, we attempt to do the following tasks:
* Perform a causal inference task using Pearlâ€™s framework;
* Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph;
* Merge machine learning with causal inference;

# Data 
You can extract the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/itsmohammadshahid/classification-of-breast-cancer-part-1-eda/data) or from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets?name=breast).
