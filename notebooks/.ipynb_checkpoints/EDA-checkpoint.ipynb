    "#### <b>Introduction</b>\n",
    "Cancer death is one of humanity's major problems in the developing world. Despite the fact that there are many ways to prevent it before happening, some cancer types still do not have a treatment. Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection is crucial in its treatment. It develops from breast tissue when cells in the region grow out of control. One of the key steps in treating breast cancer is  accurate diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b>Method</b>\n",
    "Our main objective is to identify which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer from the available Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) Data set and compare different classification algorithms to get better performance measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Keywords</b> â€“ Wisconsin Breast cancer data set, data exploration, feature selection, machine learning."
